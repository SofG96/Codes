# `pytrends` tutorial

This script offers an understanding of how to retrieve data from the [pytrends](https://github.com/GeneralMills/pytrends) Python package.

## Getting Started

This script offers example of usage of `pytrends`, an unofficial Google Trends API. It is a very useful tool to understand Google queries geographically and temporally.

### Prerequisites

When you run the script locally in your machine, please install the `pytrends` package first.

For instance, go in the Anaconda Prompt and write

```
conda activate your_env
pip install pytrends
```

`pytrends` requires `requests`, `lmxl` and `pandas`.


## Deployment

It is recommended to run the script in CoLab the first time.

To further understand how the `pytrends` queries work, please visit this webpage: https://pypi.org/project/pytrends/
